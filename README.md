# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview

Bobby's manager has given us two assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. After completing the two items I am to write a report that summarizes the analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” when current employees reach retirement age.

## Resources

- Database Tool and Software packages: pgAdmin 4, PostgreSQL, Visual Studio Code
